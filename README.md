## Project Story

### Your inspirations

### What it does
SketchTune is an innovative application that curates a personalized music playlist in real time as an artist draws or sketches. While the artist's strokes come to life on a digital canvas, the application analyzes various characteristics of their artwork—such as texture, color blending, cultural elements, and form—to select and adjust a dynamic playlist that enhances their creative flow and matches their mood. This combination of art and music creates an immersive experience, merging auditory and visual stimuli to inspire and boost creativity.
### Tech Stack
Frontend Software Framework: Svelte
- To create our digital canvas and play the recommended playlist from Spotify
  
LLM Model: Anthropic - Claude AI
- To convert images to recommended Spotify playlist
  
Spotify Search API
- Based on the recommended playlist, it would retrieve the songs from Spotify

# sv

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`sv`](https://github.com/sveltejs/cli).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npx sv create

# create a new project in my-app
npx sv create my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.
